Bank Account exercise

### What is this repository for? ###

Coding exercises for the Introduction to TDD and BDD.
Part of the A-CSD training course.

### What is this branch for? ###

* This branch showcases the use of tool `Mockito` that allows to generate mock objects dynamically,
so that they don't have to be developed manually.

* Mocks allow to specify *expectation*: expectations about the interaction with the object.

* The unit tests also showcase the use of Dummy objects, created with Mockito.
