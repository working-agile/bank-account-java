Bank Account exercise

### What is this repository for? ###

Coding exercises for the Introduction to TDD and BDD.
Part of the A-CSD training course.

### What is this branch for? ###

Here is showcased how a mock of `TransactionHistory` is used to specify (test-drive) the
intended interaction with this dependency.
It does __NOT__ show how the `TransactionHistory` itself is implemented (see branch 10).
