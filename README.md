Bank Account exercise

### What is this repository for? ###

Coding exercises for the Introduction to TDD and BDD.
Part of the A-CSD training course.

### What is this branch for? ###

Here is showcased how a stub of `TransactionHistory` is used to provide test data.

The test data is necessary to test-drive
some functionality in `BankAccount`.

It does __NOT__ show how the `TransactionHistory` itself is implemented (see branch 10).
